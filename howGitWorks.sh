# Understanding commits as snapshots
# Using git to track only changes. git doesn't remember files over and over again

# Working directory (tree): a folder that is tracked/managed by git
# (Creates the .git directory)

# Branches
# master = main branch

# The repository contains 2 different areas: 
# 1] Staging Area (index file)
# 2] Commits (Objects Folder)
